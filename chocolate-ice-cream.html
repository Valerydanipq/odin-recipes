<h3>Best Homemade Chocolate Ice Cream</h3>
<p>These chocolate cookies are pleasantly chewy, irresistibly decadent, and surprisingly easy to make with basic ingredients</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>6 oz semisweet chocolate chopped (or chocolate chips)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups whole milk</li>
    <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>⅛ tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>3 large egg yolks beaten</li>
    <li>½ tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together 1 cup cream and cocoa powder. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and boil/simmer for 30 seconds whisking constantly</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and add chopped chocolate and whisk until smooth. Add remaining 1 cup of cream and whisk to combine.</li>
    <li>Transfer mixture to a large bowl and position a fine mesh strainer over it. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together egg yolks</li>
    <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, whisk together milk, sugar and sea salt.</li>
    <li>Once the milk mixture is slightly warm, add ½ cup of warm milk to the beaten egg yolks and whisk to combine. Add the milk/egg mixture back into the saucepan, whisking during the addition.</li>
    <li>Continue to cook the custard over medium heat, and stir the mixture constantly with a spatula until the it thickens and lightly coats the spatula (it does this when it reaches about 170 degrees F)</li>
    <li>Pour the thickened custard through the metal strainer into the other ingredients in the bowl. Stir until combined. Discard any custard residue left on the strainer. </li>
    <li>Add the vanilla and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Place a lid on top and let the mixture cool in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight. To speed up the cooling process, you can place the container of the chocolate ice cream liquid base into an ice bath and stir it often.</li>
    <li>Once the ice cream mixture is cooled to just below room temperature, churn it in an ice cream maker until thick and frozen (30-40 minutes).</li>
    <li>Transfer to an airtight container and freeze for at least 6 hours.</li>
    <li>Serve!</li>
