<h3>Delicious Chocolate Cookies</h3>
<p>These chocolate cookies are pleasantly chewy, irresistibly decadent, and surprisingly easy to make with basic ingredients</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups margarine, softened</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Cream sugar and margarine in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.</li>
    <li>Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to the creamed mixture and mix until just blended. Stir in walnuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and centers are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Let sit briefly before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
