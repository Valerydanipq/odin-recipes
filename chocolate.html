<h3>Making homemade milk chocolate doesn’t need to be scary or difficult.</h3>
<p>This recipe for simple homemade dark chocolate bars comes out totally delicious and decadent tasting. Make this recipe and enjoy the chocolate goodness.</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tablespoons unsweetened dark cocoa powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons agave nectar, honey or maple syrup</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>pinch fine sea or kosher salt</li>
    <li>nuts, coconut flakes optional for topping</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>If needed, softened the coconut oil by placing in the microwave for just a few seconds.</li>
    <li>Mix all ingredients (except toppings) with a small rubber spatula, or plastic fork in a medium mixing bowl until smooth. The mixture will be thick</li>
    <li>If using a candy bar mold. Spoon the mixture into the mold(s) and spread out until even. Repeat with the other mold. I got two filled molds out of the recipe. These are supposed to be thin like a Hershey Bar</li>
    <li>If using a pan, spread into a loaf pan that’s been lined with parchment paper. Sprinkle with toppings if you chose. With hands, shape into a square. Place in freezer for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Take out, cut into small squares or rectangles. These chocolate bars must be kept in the freezer and best eaten within two days.</li>
</ol>
